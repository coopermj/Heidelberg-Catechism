\catechismqa{57}{%
What comfort does the resurrection of the body offer you?%
}{%
Not only shall my soul after this life immediately be taken up to Christ, my Head, but also this my flesh, raised by the power of Christ, shall be reunited with my soul and made like the glorious body of Christ.%
}

\catechismqa{58}{%
What comfort do you receive from the article about life everlasting?%
}{%
Even as I now already feel in my heart the beginning of eternal joy, so after this life I shall have perfect blessedness, such as no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived---a blessedness in which to praise God forever.%

\catechismqa{59}{%
But what does it help you now that you believe all this?%
}{%
In Christ I am righteous before God and an heir to life everlasting.%
}

\catechismqa{60}{%
How are you righteous before God?%
}{%
Only by true faith in Jesus Christ. Although my conscience accuses me that I have grievously sinned against all God's commandments, have never kept any of them, and am still inclined to all evil, yet God, without any merit of my own, out of mere grace, grants and credits to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, as if I had never sinned nor been a sinner, and as if I had been as perfectly obedient as Christ was obedient for me---if only I accept this gift with a believing heart.%
}

\catechismqa{61}{%
Why do you say that you are righteous only by faith?%
}{%
Not that I am acceptable to God on account of the worthiness of my faith, for only the satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ is my righteousness before God. I can receive this righteousness and make it my own by faith only.%

\catechismqa{62}{%
But why can our good works not be our righteousness before God, or at least a part of it?%
}{%
Because the righteousness which can stand before God's judgment must be absolutely perfect and wholly in agreement with the law of God, whereas even our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin.%
}

\catechismqa{63}{%
But do our good works earn nothing, even though God promises to reward them in this life and the next?%
}{%
This reward is not earned; it is a gift of grace.%
}

\catechismqa{64}{%
Does this teaching not make people careless and wicked?%
}{%
No. It is impossible that those who are grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness.%

\catechismqa{65}{%
Since then faith alone makes us share in Christ and all his benefits, where does this faith come from?%
}{%
From the Holy Spirit, who works it in our hearts by the preaching of the gospel, and strengthens it by the use of the sacraments.%
}

\catechismqa{66}{%
What are the sacraments?%
}{%
The sacraments are visible, holy signs and seals instituted by God so that by their use he may the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel: that because of the one sacrifice of Christ accomplished on the cross he grants us freely the forgiveness of all our sins and eternal life.%
}

\catechismqa{67}{%
Are both the Word and the sacraments intended to focus our faith on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross as the only ground of our salvation?%
}{%
Yes, indeed. The Holy Spirit teaches us in the gospel and assures us by the sacraments that our entire salvation rests on the one sacrifice of Christ made for us on the cross.%
}

\catechismqa{68}{%
How many sacraments has Christ instituted in the new covenant?%
}{%
Two: holy baptism and the holy supper.%
}
