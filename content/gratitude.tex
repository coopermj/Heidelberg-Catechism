%% ============================================================

\lordsday{32}

\catechismqa{86}{%
Since we have been delivered from our misery by grace alone through Christ, without any merit of our own, why must we yet do good works?%
}{%
Because Christ, having redeemed us by his blood, also renews us by his Holy Spirit to be his image, so that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for his benefits, and that he may be praised by us. Further, that we ourselves may be assured of our faith by its fruits, and that by our godly walk of life we may win our neighbours for Christ.%
}

\catechismqa{87}{%
Can those be saved who do not turn to God from their ungrateful and impenitent walk of life?%
}{%
By no means. Scripture says that no unchaste person, idolater, adulterer, thief, covetous man, drunkard, slanderer, robber, or the like shall inherit the kingdom of God.%

\catechismqa{88}{%
What is the true repentance or conversion of man?%
}{%
It is the dying of the old nature and the coming to life of the new.%
}

\catechismqa{89}{%
What is the dying of the old nature?%
}{%
It is to grieve with heartfelt sorrow that we have offended God by our sin, and more and more to hate it and flee from it.%
}

\catechismqa{90}{%
What is the coming to life of the new nature?%
}{%
It is a heartfelt joy in God through Christ, and a love and delight to live according to the will of God in all good works.%
}

\catechismqa{91}{%
But what are good works?%
}{%
Only those which are done out of true faith, in accordance with the law of God, and to his glory, and not those based on our own opinion or on precepts of men.%
}

\catechismqa{92}{%
What is the law of the Lord?%
}{%
God spoke all these words: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 1. You shall have no other gods before me. 2. You shall not make for yourself a graven image. 3. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. 4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 5. Honour your father and your mother. 6. You shall not kill. 7. You shall not commit adultery. 8. You shall not steal. 9. You shall not bear false witness. 10. You shall not covet.%
}

\catechismqa{93}{%
How are these commandments divided?%
}{%
Into two tables: the first teaches us how to live in relation to God; the second, what duties we owe our neighbour.%
}

\catechismqa{94}{%
What does the Lord require in the first commandment?%
}{%
That for the sake of my very salvation I avoid and flee all idolatry, witchcraft, superstition, and prayer to saints or to other creatures. Further, that I rightly come to know the only true God, trust in him alone, submit to him with all humility and patience, expect all good from him only, and love, fear, and honour him with all my heart. In short, that I forsake all creatures rather than do the least thing against his will.%
}

\catechismqa{95}{%
What is idolatry?%
}{%
Idolatry is having or inventing something in which to put our trust instead of, or in addition to, the only true God who has revealed himself in his Word.%

\catechismqa{96}{%
What does God require in the second commandment?%
}{%
We are not to make an image of God in any way, nor to worship him in any other manner than he has commanded in his Word.%
}

\catechismqa{97}{%
May we then not make any image at all?%
}{%
God cannot and may not be visibly portrayed in any way. Creatures may be portrayed, but God forbids us to make or have any images of them in order to worship them or to serve God through them.%
}

\catechismqa{98}{%
But may images not be tolerated in the churches as books for the laity?%
}{%
No, for we should not be wiser than God. He wants his people to be taught not by means of dumb images but by the living preaching of his Word.%
}

\catechismqa{99}{%
What is required in the third commandment?%
}{%
We are not to blaspheme or to abuse the name of God by cursing, perjury, or unnecessary oaths, nor to share in such horrible sins by being silent bystanders. Rather, we must use the holy name of God only with fear and reverence, so that we may rightly confess him, call upon him, and praise him in all our words and works.%
}

\catechismqa{100}{%
Is the blaspheming of God's name by swearing and cursing such a grievous sin that God is angry also with those who do not prevent and forbid it as much as they can?%
}{%
Certainly, for no sin is greater or provokes God's wrath more than the blaspheming of his name. That is why he commanded it to be punished with death.%
}

\vspace{0.5em}
\lordsday{37}

\catechismqa{101}{%
But may we swear an oath by the name of God in a godly manner?%
}{%
Yes, when the civil authorities require it of their subjects, or when necessity demands it, in order to maintain and promote fidelity and truth, to the glory of God and the well-being of our neighbour. Such oath-taking is grounded in God's Word and was therefore rightly used by saints in the Old and the New Testament.%
}

\catechismqa{102}{%
May we also swear by saints or other creatures?%
}{%
No. A lawful oath is a calling upon God, who alone knows the heart, to bear witness to the truth, and to punish me if I swear falsely. No creature deserves such honour.%
}

\catechismqa{103}{%
What does God require in the fourth commandment?%
}{%
First, that the ministry of the gospel and the schools be maintained and that, especially on the day of rest, I diligently attend the church of God to hear God's Word, to use the sacraments, to call publicly upon the Lord, and to give Christian offerings for the poor. Second, that all the days of my life I rest from my evil works, let the Lord work in me through his Holy Spirit, and so begin in this life the eternal Sabbath.%

\catechismqa{104}{%
What does God require in the fifth commandment?%
}{%
That I show all honour, love, and faithfulness to my father and mother and to all those in authority over me, submit myself with due obedience to their good instruction and discipline, and also bear patiently with their weaknesses and shortcomings, since it is God's will to govern us by their hand.%
}

\catechismqa{105}{%
What does God require in the sixth commandment?%
}{%
I am not to dishonour, hate, injure, or kill my neighbour by thoughts, words, or gestures, and much less by deeds, whether personally or through another; rather, I am to put away all desire of revenge. Moreover, I am not to harm or recklessly endanger myself. Therefore, also, the authorities arm themselves to prevent murder.%
}

\catechismqa{106}{%
But does this commandment speak only of killing?%
}{%
By forbidding murder God teaches us that he hates the root of murder, such as envy, hatred, anger, and desire of revenge, and that he regards all these as murder.%
}

\catechismqa{107}{%
Is it enough, then, that we do not kill our neighbour in any such way?%
}{%
No. When God condemns envy, hatred, and anger, he requires us to love our neighbour as ourselves, to show patience, peace, gentleness, mercy, and friendliness toward him, to protect him from harm as much as we can, and also to do good even to our enemies.%

\catechismqa{108}{%
What does the seventh commandment teach us?%
}{%
That all unchastity is cursed by God. We must therefore detest it from the heart and live chaste and disciplined lives, both within and outside of holy marriage.%
}

\catechismqa{109}{%
Does God in this commandment forbid nothing more than adultery and similar shameful sins?%
}{%
Since we, body and soul, are temples of the Holy Spirit, it is God's will that we keep ourselves pure and holy. Therefore he forbids all unchaste acts, gestures, words, thoughts, desires, and whatever may entice us to unchastity.%
}

\catechismqa{110}{%
What does God forbid in the eighth commandment?%
}{%
God forbids not only theft and robbery which the authorities punish, but God also labels as theft all wicked tricks and schemes by which we seek to get for ourselves our neighbour's goods, whether by force or under the appearance of right, such as false weights and measures, deceptive advertising or merchandising, counterfeit money, or usury; also all greed and wasteful abuse of his gifts.%
}

\catechismqa{111}{%
What does God require of you in this commandment?%
}{%
That I promote my neighbour's good wherever I can and may, deal with him as I would like others to deal with me, and work faithfully so that I may be able to give to those in need.%
}

\vspace{0.5em}
\lordsday{43}

\catechismqa{112}{%
What is required in the ninth commandment?%
}{%
That I bear false witness against no one, twist no one's words, be no backbiter or slanderer, join in condemning no one unheard or rashly. Rather, I must avoid, on pain of God's heavy wrath, all lying and deceit as the devil's own works. In court and everywhere else, I must love the truth, speak and confess it honestly, and do what I can to defend and promote my neighbour's honour and reputation.%
}

%% LORD'S DAY XLIV

\catechismqa{113}{%
What does the tenth commandment require of us?%
}{%
That not even the slightest thought or desire contrary to any of God's commandments should ever arise in our heart. Rather, we should always hate all sin with all our heart and delight in all righteousness.%
}

\catechismqa{114}{%
But can those converted to God keep these commandments perfectly?%
}{%
No. Even the holiest of them make only a small beginning in this obedience in this life. Nevertheless, they begin with earnest purpose to live not only according to some but according to all the commandments of God.%
}

\catechismqa{115}{%
If in this life no one can keep the ten commandments perfectly, why does God have them preached so strictly?%
}{%
First, that all our life long we may more and more come to know our sinful nature, and so become the more eager to seek the forgiveness of sins and righteousness in Christ. Second, that we may continually strive and ask God for the grace of the Holy Spirit, so that more and more we may be renewed in the image of God, until after this life we reach the goal of perfection.%

\catechismqa{116}{%
Why is prayer necessary for Christians?%
}{%
Because it is the chief part of the thankfulness which God requires of us, and because God will give his grace and Holy Spirit only to those who constantly and with heartfelt longing ask him for these gifts and thank him for them.%
}

\catechismqa{117}{%
What belongs to a prayer which pleases God and is heard by him?%
}{%
First, that we sincerely call upon the one true God only, who has revealed himself in his Word, for all that he has commanded us to pray. Second, that we thoroughly know our need and misery, so that we may humble ourselves before God. Third, that we rest on this firm foundation, that although we do not deserve it, God will certainly hear our prayer for the sake of Christ our Lord, as he has promised us in his Word.%
}

\catechismqa{118}{%
What has God commanded us to ask of him?%
}{%
All the things we need for body and soul, as included in the prayer which Christ our Lord himself taught us.%
}

\catechismqa{119}{%
What is the Lord's Prayer?%
}{%
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.%

\catechismqa{120}{%
Why has Christ commanded us to address God as Our Father?%
}{%
To awaken in us at the very beginning of our prayer that childlike reverence and trust toward God which should be the ground of our prayer: God has become our Father through Christ and will much less deny us what we ask of him in faith than our parents would refuse us earthly things.%
}

\catechismqa{121}{%
Why is there added, Who art in heaven?%
}{%
That we might have no earthly conception of the heavenly majesty of God, and that we might expect from his almighty power all things needed for body and soul.%
