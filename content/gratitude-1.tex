\catechismqa{86}{%
Since we have been delivered from our misery by grace alone through Christ, without any merit of our own, why must we yet do good works?%
}{%
Because Christ, having redeemed us by his blood, also renews us by his Holy Spirit to be his image, so that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for his benefits, and that he may be praised by us. Further, that we ourselves may be assured of our faith by its fruits, and that by our godly walk of life we may win our neighbours for Christ.%
}

\catechismqa{87}{%
Can those be saved who do not turn to God from their ungrateful and impenitent walk of life?%
}{%
By no means. Scripture says that no unchaste person, idolater, adulterer, thief, covetous man, drunkard, slanderer, robber, or the like shall inherit the kingdom of God.%

In short, that I forsake all creatures rather than do the least thing against his will.%
