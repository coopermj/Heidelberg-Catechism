\catechismqa{24}{%
How are these articles divided?%
}{%
Into three parts: the first is about God the Father and our creation; the second about God the Son and our redemption; the third about God the Holy Spirit and our sanctification.%
}

\catechismqa{25}{%
Since there is only one God, why do you speak of three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?%
}{%
Because God has so revealed himself in his Word that these three distinct persons are the one, true, eternal God.%

\catechismqa{26}{%
What do you believe when you say: I believe in God the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?%
}{%
That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who out of nothing created heaven and earth and all that is in them, and who still upholds and governs them by his eternal counsel and providence, is, for the sake of Christ his Son, my God and my Father. In him I trust so completely as to have no doubt that he will provide me with all things necessary for body and soul, and will also turn to my good whatever adversity he sends me in this life of sorrow. He is able to do so as almighty God, and willing also as a faithful Father.%

\lordsday{10}

\catechismqa{27}{%
What do you understand by the providence of God?%
}{%
God's providence is his almighty and ever present power, whereby, as with his hand, he still upholds heaven and earth and all creatures, and so governs them that leaf and blade, rain and drought, fruitful and barren years, food and drink, health and sickness, riches and poverty, indeed, all things, come to us not by chance but by his fatherly hand.%
}

\catechismqa{28}{%
What does it benefit us to know that God has created all things and still upholds them by his providence?%
}{%
We can be patient in adversity, thankful in prosperity, and with a view to the future we can have a firm confidence in our faithful God and Father that no creature shall separate us from his love; for all creatures are so completely in his hand that without his will they cannot so much as move.%

\lordsday{11}

\catechismqa{29}{%
Why is the Son of God called Jesus, that is, Saviour?%
}{%
Because he saves us from all our sins, and because salvation is not to be sought or found in anyone else.%
}

\catechismqa{30}{%
Do those who seek their salvation or well-being in saints, in themselves, or anywhere else, also believe in the only Saviour Jesus?%
}{%
No. Though they boast of him in words, they in fact deny the only Saviour Jesus. For one of two things must be true: either Jesus is not a complete Saviour, or those who by true faith accept this Saviour must find in him all that is necessary for their salvation.%

\lordsday{12}

\catechismqa{31}{%
Why is he called Christ, that is, Anointed?%
}{%
Because he has been ordained by God the Father, and anointed with the Holy Spirit, to be our chief Prophet and Teacher, who has fully revealed to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our redemption; our only High Priest, who by the one sacrifice of his body has redeemed us, and who continually intercedes for us before the Father; and our eternal King, who governs us by his Word and Spirit, and who defends and preserves us in the redemption obtained for us.%
}

\catechismqa{32}{%
Why are you called a Christian?%
}{%
Because I am a member of Christ by faith and thus share in his anointing, so that I may as prophet confess his name, as priest present myself a living sacrifice of thankfulness to him, and as king fight with a free and good conscience against sin and the devil in this life, and hereafter reign with him eternally over all creatures.%

\lordsday{13}

\catechismqa{33}{%
Why is he called God's only-begotten Son, since we also are children of God?%
}{%
Because Christ alone is the eternal, natural Son of God. We, however, are children of God by adoption, through grace, for Christ's sake.%
}

\catechismqa{34}{%
Why do you call him our Lord?%
}{%
Because he has ransomed us, body and soul, from all our sins, not with silver or gold but with his precious blood, and has freed us from all the power of the devil to make us his own possession.%

\catechismqa{35}{%
What do you confess when you say: He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary?%
}{%
The eternal Son of God, who is and remains true and eternal God, took upon himself true human nature from the flesh and blood of the virgin Mary, through the working of the Holy Spirit. Thus he is also the true seed of David, and like his brothers in every respect, yet without sin.%
}

\catechismqa{36}{%
What benefit do you receive from the holy conception and birth of Christ?%
}{%
He is our Mediator, and with his innocence and perfect holiness covers, in the sight of God, my sin, in which I was conceived and born.%
}
